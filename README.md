- Hi, I'm Igal Press and I generally do data science for physics research related topics.
- I speak English, Russian, and Hebrew, and am confident in my French and Japanese given enough time living in the respective areas.
- So far I've worked at Triumf in Vancouver, BC for the Tokai-To-Kamioka (T2K) collaboration with a focus on electron/gamma separation in the Super-K far detector.
    - This work was mainly focused on machine learning applications using the ResNet CNN model using Python.
- I've also worked in Tokai, and Tsukuba in Japan for the TRIUMF Ultra-Cold Advanced Neutron Project (TUCAN).
    - Half this job was focused on lab work in the accelerator with apparatus setup and data acquisition in Tokai.
    - The other half was conducted in Tsukuba where I used C++ and Root to analyze the acquisitioned data which was acquired over the preceeding 5 weeks.
    - A large part of this job was utilizing effective communication skills to convey the analysis properly.
    - I presented my research several times at various competitions.
        - I traveled to Guelph, Ontario for the 2022 Canadian Undergraduate Physics Conference and won fourth place in both the poster presentation section and the oral presentation section.
        - I also competed in the Randy Kobes poster competition held annualy at The University of Winnipeg.
- Iâ€™m currently in my fourth year of the Mathematical Physics Honours degree at The University of Winnipeg.
- Please feel free to reach out to me at press.igal@gmail.com if you have any questions!
